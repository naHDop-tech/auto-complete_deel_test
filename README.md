# Auto complete drop down

Test task for the [Deel](https://www.deel.com/)

> Role: Frontend engineer

> Grade: Middle+/Senior

> Duration time: 90 minutes

> Due time: 48 h


# Description
Please prepare an auto-complete component in React TypeScript.
1. You cannot use any 3rd party libraries - only pure React and internal DOM
functions.
2. You should use typescript and write proper interfaces and types.
3. The function to filter the data should be asynchronous. You can use mock data
(such as a JSON array), but the function which uses it should be asynchronous
(similar to a real REST call).

4. It should have basic working CSS. No need for anything fancy (such as drop-
shadows etc), but should look decent.

5. You need to handle all non-standard/edge use-cases - it should have a perfect
user-experience.
6. Highlight the matching part of the text, in addition to showing it.
7. No external state management libraries (refer to #1 as well), only native React
method.
8. Use only functional component with hooks.
9. Shortcuts and hacks are perfectly ok - but you have to add comments on what
are you doing there and why. You should either write production ready code or
include comments on what needs to be changed for production.
10. Add a README.md file explaining how to run the project.
11. Bonus #1: load data using a real API call to some resource.
Results need to be in the form of a GitHub repo link.
